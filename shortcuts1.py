# Useful shortcuts (towards using your mouse less and being faster!)
#
# WRITTEN WITH MAC OS IN MIND; SEE NOTES BELOW FOR WINDOWS
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# note: i'm abbreviating "command" with "cmd" for mac keyboards
#
# note: on windows, try swapping the "ctrl" key for the "cmd" key, and "alt" with "option"
# if this doesn't work, some experimenting should help.  i can help too)
# 
# for more info, can search online for "sublime text shortcuts" etc., will find pages such as:

# 
# (cmd + z) undoes your last action.  this can be used to step back multiple steps
#
# holding down the (shift) key and moving the cursor will select everything you cover
#
# (cmd + c) "copy" and (cmd + v) "paste" work just like in a text editor
#
# with nothing selected, (cmd + c) copies the current line 
# "                   ", (cmd + x) cuts the current line (you can paste it)
# 
# (control + shift + k)  deletes the current line.  the line can't be pasted
# (control + k) deletes everything after the cursor on a line
#
# THIS IS SUPER USEFUL FOR CREATING REPETIVE BLOCKS OF CODE!!!
## for instance, just put your cursor on some random line of code (using your mouse or
## arrow keys).  with nothing selected, press (cmd + c).  now paste (cmd + v).  the copied
## line should appear on a new line below the cursor.  you can move your cursor around
## to paste the line wherever you like
#
# (cmd + left/right) moves the cursor to the beginning/end of line
# (option + left/right) moves the curser by one word to the left/right
# NOTE: CHECK THESE IF YOU'RE ON WINDOWS!  It may be (alt + left/right) to move to
# the beginning/end of line, etc
#
# (cmd + enter) starts a blank new line below the cursor, regardless of where the cursor is
#
# holding down the (shift) key will select everything that cursor subsequently moves over.
# selections can be copied, cut, deleted, etc
#
# (control + g) lets you enter a line number to jump to
#
# (cmd + ]) indents the current line
# (cmd + ]) unindents the current line
# note: this can be used to (un)indent multiple selected lines of code
