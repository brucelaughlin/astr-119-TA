# Choose any of the problems below; if you finish one, try to do the
# "challenge" part of the problem or choose another to try!


# 1 
# Create a program that contains dictionaries for each person in
# your group, and call the dictionaries "person_1", "person_2", etc..
# Use the same "key :value" pairs in each dictionary.
# One "key : value" pair should identify a person somehow,
# and the rest should describe other attributes of a person.
# Finally, print all of the dictionaries

# 2
# Create a program which defines the function "fun_with_modulo".  This
# program should take an int x as its argument and print one of four
# strings of your choice depending on the modulus of x with 4 (i.e x modulo 4, or
# the integer remainder when x is divided by 4).
# 
# Challenge: 
# Import this program as a module into another program 
# which takes integer user input and feeds it to the "fun_with_modulo" function
# Extra: Use exceptions to handle non-integer number input

# 3
# Create a program which defines the function "fun_with_e" which 
# takes as its argument a positive number x and returns e^x + ln(x).
# Define a positive number x with user input or by hardcoding it,
# and print the ouput of fun_with_e(x)
#
# Challenge: 
# Import this program as a module into another program 
# which takes integer user input and feeds it to the module function
# Extra: Use exceptions to handle non-positive number input

# 4
# Create a program which defines a function "more_fun_with_e" which takes as its argument
# a 4-element array "arr1" and creates a new array "arr2" in which,
# for each element x in "arr1", "arr2" has a corresponding element 
# whose values is e^x + ln(x).  
# Define a 4-element array of positive floats "arr1" with user input or by hardcoding it,
# and print arr1 and the output of more_fun_with_e(arr2)
#
# Challenge: 
# Import this program as a module in another program 
# which takes positive number user input to create a 4-element array and
# then and passes this array to "more_fun_with_e" as an argument.
# Print the input array and the output array.
# Extra: Use exceptions to handle non-positive number input


# 5
# Create a program that defines a function "num_digits" that takes an integer 
# as its argument and returns the number of digits of the number.  Define an integer
# within your program to test your code.
# Hints are available, this one might be more math-y!!
#
# Challenge:
# Import this program as a module in another program 
# which takes integer user input and feeds it to the module function.
# Extra: Use exceptions to handle non-integer input

# 6 (tricky problem!)
# Create a program that defines a function "primes" which takes a positive integer as its 
# argument and prints out all of the prime numbers of value less than or equal
# to the input integer.
# Hints are available, this one might be more math-y!!
#
# Challenge: 
# Import this program as a module in another program 
# which takes integer user input and feeds it to the module function.
# Extra: Use exceptions to handle non-positive non-integer input
