# Choose any of the problems below; if you finish one, 
# choose another and keep working!


# 1 
# Create a program that contains dictionaries for each person in
# your group, and call the dictionaries "person_1", "person_2", etc..
# Use the same "key :value" pairs in each dictionary.
# One "key : value" pair should identify a person somehow,
# and the rest should describe other attributes of a person.
# Finally, print all of the dictionaries

# 2
# Create a program containing the function "fun_with_e" which 
# takes as input a positive number x and returns e^x + ln(x)
#
# Challenge: 
# Import this program as a module into another program 
# which takes integer input and feeds it to the module function
# Use exceptions to handle non-positive number input

# 3
# Create a program which defines a function "more_fun_with_e" which takes as input
# a 4-element array "arr1" and creates a new array "arr2" in which,
# for each element x in "arr1", "arr2" has a corresponding element 
# whose values is e^x + ln(x).  
# Define a 4-element array of positive floats "arr1" within your program to test your code.
# Print arr1 and arr2
#
# Challenge: 
# Import this program as a module in another program 
# which takes positive number input to create a 4-element array and
# then and passes this array to "more_fun_with_e" as an argument.
# Print the input array and the output array.
# Use exceptions to handle non-positive number input


# 4
# Create a program that defines a function "num_digits" that takes an integer 
# as input and returns the number of digits of the number.  Define an integer
# within your program to test your code.
# Hints are available, this one might be more math-y!!
#
# Challenge:
# Import this program as a module in another program 
# which takes integer input and feeds it to the module function.
# Use exceptions to handle non-integer input

# 5 (challenge problem!)
# Create a program that takes an integer as input and prints
# out all of the prime numbers of value less than or equal
# to the input integer.
# Hints are available, this one might be more math-y!!
#
# Challenge: 
# Import this program as a module in another program 
# which takes integer input and feeds it to the module function.
# Use exceptions to handle non-integer input
